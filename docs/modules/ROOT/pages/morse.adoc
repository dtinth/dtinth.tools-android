= Morse code notifier

Whenever a notification is received, vibrate the device with a morse code pattern of the first 3 initials.

== Example

For example, if you receive a notification with the title "Hello, world!", the device will vibrate with the pattern ".... .--" (H W).

When receiving a chat message, usually the notification title is the name of the sender. So you can guess who sent the message from the vibration pattern.

== How to enable

To enable: **Settings** &rarr; **Apps** &rarr; **⋮** &rarr; **Special access** &rarr; **Notification access** and enable **dtinth’s Tools**.
